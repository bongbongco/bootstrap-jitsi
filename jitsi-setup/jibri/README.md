# Jibri Installation

First, install by running `bash jibri-install.sh` as root

If you run into an error like:
`modprobe: FATAL: Module snd-aloop not found in directory /lib/modules/4.4.0-1052-aws`

Please refer to this [StackOverflow Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49538514/sound-driver-snd-aloop-kernel-module-setup-issue-with-aws-ec2-ubuntu-16-04-ins#49617051)


Then configure with `bash jibri-configure.sh`
